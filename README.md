# Advent of Code 2020


# Notes

## Pre-start

No real plan or language preference this year. I'd like to mess around with Pony some more but 
might just keep it normal. Going to focus on getting the most minimal answers I can muster but still
test fully. 

$5 says we end up building a computer. 


## Day 1

Ah man 503s.

Heeeey we got inputs! Alright. Not the most elegant solution but we're 2 stars closer. Gonna massage
how the project looks a little now.
